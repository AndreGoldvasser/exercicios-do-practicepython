# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the
# SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file
# is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each
# line in the file contains a single word.
#
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
