# Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether
# anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a
# column, or a diagonal. Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board
# there will only be one winner.
